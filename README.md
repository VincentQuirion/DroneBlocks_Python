This code needs a few dependencies to work.

If you don't want to use facial recognition, you'll just need to install dronekit.

If you do want to use facial recognition, you'll need to install everything used in this tutorial -> https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/25/raspberry-pi-face-recognition/

This code was only meant to demo at the science fair. If you want to use it anyway and you have any question, feel free to message me on LinkedIn -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-quirion-51a3731b6/
